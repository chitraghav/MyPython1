Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.For example, the square matrix is shown below:1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .Function descriptionComplete the function in the editor below.diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Returnint: the absolute diagonal difference
Input FormatThe first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next lines describes a row, , and consists of space-separated integers .ConstraintsOutput FormatReturn the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.Sample Input3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output15
ExplanationThe primary diagonal is:11
5
-12
Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4The secondary diagonal is: 4
5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15Note: |x| is the absolute value of x

// REDO: Input should be in mathematical matrix form
